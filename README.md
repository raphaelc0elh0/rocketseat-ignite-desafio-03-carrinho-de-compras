* Throw and display errors

*Tools:*

## Installation
1. Install it by running `yarn` in the project's root directory
2. Run the project with `yarn start`
3. Build the project with `yarn build`

## Notes
* As an exercise, this project wasn’t focused on advanced optimizations regarding data storage, processing, accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, etc. There’s still a lot to be done about it.
* As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, feel free to get in touch, here is my email - raphael.lima.coelho@gmail.com
